Attended a free class in building a website from scratch with HTML & CSS that was held in the Microsoft Office at Times Square. They have the coolest elevators ever! Your floor is programmed into your visitors pass so when you insert it into the gate, the gate tells an elevator where you need to go. You then proceed to the elevator the gate has assigned to you. When I stepped in, I looked for floor number buttons. None were present! Just the emergency , door open and door close buttons. 
It was cool building the website from scratch because it is super intimidating to do it at first without guidance.
