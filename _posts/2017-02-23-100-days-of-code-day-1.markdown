I've been hitting a wall lately and it might be due to lack of sleep. Started #100days of code challenge today to build up a habit of coding again. I had a nice streak going for almost a month before it unraveled but alas, try try again! A rocky start, just 20 minutes today. Practiced using debugger on chrome console. It's very useful to decipher how exactly a piece of code works.
