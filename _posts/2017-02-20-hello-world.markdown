**Hello World!** I am *very* excited to write this post because it is one of the many steps I am taking in my journey to learn how to code. I mainly created this blog for personal accountability reasons so that I would stick to learning how to code as well as to document the process. 

**What languages are you learning?**

I am starting with the fundamentals of web development: html, css and Javascript. I am currently on JS functions, objects, loops, methods, etc

**Why are you learning to code?**

Do you know that quote you can't make something from nothing? I feel like coding completely defies that in the way that in real life everything is tangible and can be touched and held, while for code, it's not tangible in the touching sense. Yet it is so powerful. I basically see coding/programming as a superpower because it's telling computers what to do. Computers are capable of doing more and more every year. It's the age of AI! I am learning to code because I want to change the world and code is capable of doing it by scale. Coding also makes me feel super empowered. I love creating things. I live for the "Yes!! My code worked/ Resolved the issue!!" moments.

 This blog took quite a while to set up!

I googled so hard on how to set up a blog via Jekyll and GitHub. There was 2 phases. Phase 1 was when I would follow a tutorial but the terminal would return an error message because the tutorial failed to mention the necessary prerequisite things that needed to be installed. That lead to further googling to figure out why it was returning those errors and how to fix them. I used tips from at least 7 different sources and troubleshooted. The problem with that was that it was like trying to make sense of a jumble of pieces with out being able to see the big picture. I finally found [this awesome tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) that actually walked you through exactly what you needed to do.
