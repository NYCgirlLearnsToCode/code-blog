20 minutes of googling where the index.html file went when Jekyll updated = index.html is now default.html located in _layouts

```
bundle show minima
```
command must be used while in jekyll blog directory

I don't want to learn liquid to make jekyll themes so maybe I should switch to hexo... or just make themes and preview via localhost ;-;
